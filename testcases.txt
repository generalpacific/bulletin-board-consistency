Test cases:

1. Sequential:
  Execute few commands from client1 to server1
  Execute read command on client2 which connects to server2

  Commands:
    client1:
      connect 128.101.35.195
      post article1
      post article1
      read
      reply 1 article3
      read
      disconnect

    client2:
      connect 128.101.35.178
      read
      disconnect

  All reads give latest values.
	
2. Quorum:
  start 5 servers, 2 clients
  Nw = 3, Nr = 3
  
  client 1:
    connect 128.101.35.195
    post article1
    post article2
    read
    reply 2 article3
    disconnect
  
  client 2:
    connect 128.101.35.195
    read
	post article4
	read
    disconnect
	
  client 1:
	connect 128.101.35.178
	read
	disconnect

  All reads should show all the outputs. Writes should give more performance than sequential.
  Reads should be expensive.
	
3. Read Your Write:
  connect 128.101.35.195
  post article1
  post article2
  read
  disconnect
  
  connect 128.101.35.178
  read
  disconnect

  The second read should take a comparatively more time as it is sent to server.
  While first read is retrieved from cache, so faster read.

4. Nested Printing:
Commands:
  connect 128.101.35.195
  post article1
  post article2
  read
  reply 1 article3
  reply 3 article4
  post article 5
  reply 2 article6
  read
  disconnect
  
5. Start server with wrong Nr, Nw values (logical Nw>N/2 and Nr+Nw > N). Client will get a remote exception in this case.

6. Execute choose before read, should give error. For more explanation see design.txt.

7. Test latest article id generation at coordinator by running two clients at the same time.

8. Test invalid reply and choose. Reply and choose and invalid article id.

9. Execute operations without connecting to server, i.e., without calling connect first.

10. Server: Invalid arguments (rmi server, rmi port and properties file are invalid).

11. Server Config : if consistency type is quorum and Nr and Nw are not given ,error out.

12. If consistency type is not mentioned in server config, error out.

13. Invalid command should not be executed.

14. If Nr and Nw are invalid or negative numbers you cannot start the server.
