Test cases:

Sequential:
  1. client - server
  Execute few commands from client1 to server1
  Execute read command on client2 which connects to server2

  Commands:
    client1:
      connect 128.101.35.195
      post article1
      post article1
      read
      reply 1 article3
      read
      disconnect

    client2:
      connect 128.101.35.178
      read
      disconnect

  All reads give latest values.
	
Quorum:
  start 5 servers, 2 clients
  Nw = 3, Nr = 3
  
  client 1:
    connect 128.101.35.195
    post article1
    post article2
    read
    reply 2 article3
    disconnect
  
  client 2:
    connect 128.101.35.195
    read
	post article4
	read
    disconnect
	
  client 1:
	connect 128.101.35.178
	read
	disconnect

  All reads should show all the outputs. Writes should give more performance than sequential.
  Reads should be expensive.
	
Read Your Write:
  connect 128.101.35.195
  post article1
  post article2
  read
  disconnect
  
  connect 128.101.35.178
  read
  disconnect

  The second read should take a lot of time as it is sent to server.
  While first read is retrieved from cache, so faster read.
